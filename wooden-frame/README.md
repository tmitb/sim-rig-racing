I have implemented two phases of the rig build. There is bits of build logs for each phase below.

## Requirements
- Triple screen setup
- Isolated platform between screens and rig
- Center console
- Dash

## Build log
### Phase 1
I have built a stand to test out 43" Single TV setup.

#### BOM
- 2x6 104" 5/8 dimensional lumber x2
- 2" 1/2 deck screw x25
- TV wall mount

#### Description
I had a bunch of 2x6 104" 5/8 dimensional lumber that I bought in the cull lumber lot at a local hardware store. It costed me about 50 Loonies(Canadian dollar) for 30 pcs. Being cull lumbers, some of them are only partially usable or bent a bit, I picked some of the straighter ones to build the stand.

The stand required 2pcs of 2x6 104" 5/8. Each pcs were cut twice to end up with 2pcs 33" and 1pc 38" 1/2.
A 33" piece and 38" 1/2 piece form a T-shaped to serve as a leg, where longer piece is standing vertically. After the two were created, I put a 33" on top of two foot, then place the last 33" piece to form a face plate which is screwed to the top and two legs act as a face plate and a brace at the same time. Then a TV wall mount was added to the face place. I bought the mount in a local surplus shop for 25 Loonies when it was on sale.

After taxes and some screws, which I bought in bulk about 10 years ago, it will come out about 35 Loonies (around USD 25 at the time of the writing).

### Phase 2
After about a week trial with the single TV setup, I have decided to move on with the triple TV setup.

#### BOM
- 2x6 104" 5/8 dimensional lumber x7
- scrap 2x4 pieces varies in length x4
- 2" 1/2 deck screw x100
- TV wall mount x2
- Sub-floor tile (24"x24") x3
- Monitor Arm

#### Description
The focus was on the platform for the pedal, seat, and steering wheel mount. I have been using a cheap Amazon mount for a bit. I liked the chair so that was keept but the shaky pedal mount and wheel mount must go.

For the basic platform, I have cut 2x6 104" 5/8 in to two pieces, one that is 21 inches, and the other 72 inches to form a 24"x72" base platform. This required two pieces of the lumber and left with some scraps. Once the base was created, I went to a local hardware store to source some plywood panels, then I stumbled upon a 24"x24" sub-flooring tile. The tile has tounge and groove. It had a plastic bottom. It had correct dimensions. AND it was cheaper than buying plywood panels!. So I just changed the course and brought back 3 tiles. It has plastic bottom with OBS top, which is not ideal because you will get splinters overtime. So I filpped it and used the plastic parts as the top surface. It has dimples on it to create moisture pass when used as sub-flooring, but that was not needed for me. It is just better grippy surface for shoes, though I only where socks when driving. It will provide me a good accupressure treatment everyday.

Then I cut the last dimensional lumber to 3 pieces, 2x 26" 1/2 and 1x 27. I attached two shorter pieces to the platform to create a leg then put the top piece across them to make the stand for the wheel to mount eventually.

Then I started mount the pedal and seat. Pedal mounting was straight forward, just screwed them in to the floor. The seat needs to be boxed in by screwing in some scrap blocks around it. One of the scrap piece is placed to also prvent the seat from lifting by grabbing a small tounge in the chair. I mounted my open case to the space in front of the pedals to finish the build. Once built, I slide the entire platfrom undernethe the center TV stand.

I have 3D printeted the wheel to the stand mount. I was designing something that I can do a bit of telescoping, but gave up on it after couple hours because I just wanted to play with all the new fancy toys, and there isn't a way to adjust the seat anyways so no point on spending extra time provoding adjustability to the wheel itself. However, I will for sure to get to the sliding seat and tilt/telescoping one day.

I played a bit after the platform was built and before two extra TVs were put in places. Everything was rock sturdy and I am really happy with the result.

With one already built, I needed two more identical stands. That was done in no time. The challenge was to align them correctly. First, I adjusted one side based on my peripheral vision and amount of head movement I have when I drive a real car. Then bring a letter size paper to the point where two screen meets, and then fold one side to find the angle. Use this paper as a template, I adjusted another monitor to match exact angle. After that, I downloaded a protractor app and used that to find the exact number and put that to the game I had.

It took two entire days to complete the build. The entire experiance is fantastic. Having a pole to win session on the first race after completing the rig build was a cherry on top.

Having RTX5090 gave me a good(or bad depending on how you see it) idea of having an extra monitor on top of the center because RTX5090 can drive up to 5 mointors and I had one monitor laying around. So I got a monitor arm and mounted to the center stand. This will have OBS on for my streaming, though the streaming is more of an archieving rather than showing it to others.

This concludes the Phase 2, which is the major part of the build. I have some other ideas, mainly accessory mounts and center console, but nothing solid yet.
