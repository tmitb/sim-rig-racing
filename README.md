This is a repository for tracking progresses and history about all things `Racing Sim` that are related to my own rigs. This `README` Section will log all the progress below, showing the most recent changes first. Each project folder may be referred in this document for more details, and items.

### Frame
- [Custom built wooden frame](https://github.com/tmitb/sim-rig-racing/tree/main/wooden-frame#readme)

### Noteworthy accessories
- Ventilated seat pad [Aliexpress link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007196227825.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.4b971802pqZyDx)
  - I absolutely love it.
  - If it gets too hot and you sweat sitting in too long for a session, this is a great accessory to get under $50.
  - You need to get 12v DC adapter from somewhere. I had one laying around in my DC adaptor pile, but you may need to get one. It requires 2A at 12v.
  - It is a bit noisy, so if you want to speak with an open mic, probably not a good option.
